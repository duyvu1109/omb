# Part 6 - Draining backlogs - notes

See the README.md files under `driver-kafka` and `driver-redpanda` for details on deployment and running the benchmarks.

The scripts in this directory are those for running the benchmarks of part 6. You'll need to copy them to `/opt/benchmark` on the control host to run them.

Note, there was some copying and pasting from the originals to this blog directory after the fact, hopefully there are no typos or other issues, let me know if you find something.
